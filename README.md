# 🎉 Simple Notes App 📓✨

Welcome to the **Simple Notes App**! The most straightforward way to jot down your ideas, thoughts, and everything in between—while watching me *level-up* my React skills! 🚀

## 🛠️ About the Project

This is a **React-based web app** that lets you create, edit, and manage your notes in a minimalistic interface. What makes it special? Well, it's not just about note-taking—it's about **practicing React** with a sprinkle of **TypeScript**, a dash of **Bootstrap**, and of course, **react-router-dom** (because navigating around should be easy, right?). 😎

### Why was it built?
This project focuses primarily on practicing React, particularly on **routing**. So, if you're into coding or learning about routing in React apps, you're in for a treat! 🍬

## 🔥 Features

- **Create Notes** 📝: Add your personal thoughts, to-dos, or recipes!
- **Edit Notes** ✍️: Change anything you want, because your notes are your world!
- **Delete Notes** 🗑️: Oops, deleted that by mistake? Just kidding, we won't judge! (Or will we?)
- **React Router** 🚗: Effortlessly navigate between different pages—no more boring old refreshes.
- **TypeScript** for that **extra layer of safety** 🦾: Because who doesn’t love some type-checking love?
- **Bootstrap** for a beautiful and responsive design 💅: Clean, simple, and stylish.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (The heart and soul of this app ❤️)
- **Vite** (Because we like fast builds, no more waiting around ⏱️)
- **TypeScript** (Because who doesn’t love a little extra type safety? 💪)
- **React Router** (To make your journeys within the app smooth and seamless 🚀)
- **Bootstrap** (For styling—because we all need a little flair 👗)

## 🚀 How to Run the App Locally

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/potakaaa/simple-notes-app.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd simple-notes-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Open it up in your browser and start taking notes (or just pretend to for now—we won’t judge 😉).

## 🎯 Next Steps

As I continue building and refining the app, here's what you can expect to see:

- More **features** to enhance the note-taking experience.
- Adding **authentication** so you can keep your notes private (maybe a "dark mode" for those late-night writing sessions? 🌙).
- Better **state management** (yes, I'm looking at you, Redux or Context API!).
- A ton of **performance optimizations**—because we don't like slow apps! ⏳
